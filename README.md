MicroPub support for Static Blog Engine
=======================================

**Note** This release removes support for syndicating to twitter.com.

This php script provides micropub support for Static Site Generators. Incoming posts are rewritten to a suitable front-matter format and saved to the user's content store.

Currently, the script will handle the following indieweb functions:-

- [notes](https://indieweb.org/note)
- [articles](https://indieweb.org/article)
- [replies](https://indieweb.org/reply), adding the **title** of the article/note you are replying to. Replies can be syndicated to external services.
- [photos](https://indieweb.org/note), note that this functionality _requires_ the use of JSON-posts. **nanopub** is not presently equipped to handle multipart uploads
- [checkins](https://indieweb.org/checkin), this functionality is heavily informed by [OwnYourSwarm](https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io/) and the format that service uses
- [bookmarks](https://indieweb.org/bookmark)
- [like-of](https://indieweb.org/like)
- [repost](https://indieweb.org/repost)

**nanopub** offers the following functionality as described in the formal [Micropub Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/)

Required
--------
- Supports header and form parameter methods of authentication
- Supports creating posts using `x-www-form-urlencoded` syntax

Optional
--------
- Supports updating and deleting posts
- Supports JSON syntax and source content query
- Supports replacement and deletion of limited set of properties
- As it uses a separate Media Endpoint it provides configuration query

[Full implementation report](https://micropub.rocks/implementation-reports/servers/132/dohoQpnIdZYxrwcpMgzj) is available on [micropub.rocks](https://micropub.rocks/)

**nanopub** additionally supports syndication of content to external silos. Currently it provides syndication to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social), although it also provides a framework implementation for any modern API-based endpoint. An example is provided of the script pinging the [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) service to update the user's feed.

The code is self-explanatory and documented, and can be adjusted easily to meet different needs.

Installation
------------

Please refer to the [Installation Notes](INSTALLATION.md)

Client Notes
------------
**nanopub** expects data inputs in accordance with the current (May 2017) Micropub Spec, and does not gracefully handled deprecated formats. In particular:

- `mp-slug`, not `slug` when setting the content of the slug property
- `mp-syndicate-to` not `syndicate-to` when setting syndication targets for POSSE

Any errors resulting from use of the deprecated formats are a matter for the client.

TODO
----
* [ ] Make a `setup.php` script to complete the required configuration settings.
* [ ] Implement rsvp's, itineraries &c
* [ ] Trigger sitegen on succesful operation.
